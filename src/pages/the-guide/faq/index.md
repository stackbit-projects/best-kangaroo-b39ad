**Not yet complete. - Ideas for frequently asked questions**

**1. Who created the guide?**<br>
I'm [Terry Brown](https://terrybrown.me), and I've been a software engineering lead in some form or another through a lot of my later career.  I had performed the role very badly in my early career, and during those early years when I first started, I wish I had had a structured approach/tool to support the early conversations I had with my own managers, my teams, and to give me some structure for my own growth.<br>
In my later career, I'm driven by creating environments where teams can thrive and do their best work - with a heavy focus on high performing culture, psychological safety, and continuous improvement.<br>
In my personal life, I'm married and have 3 kids.  I am an active LGBT+ ally and my pronouns are he/him, and I enjoy getting away from this with cycling, running and more recently rowing.

**2. How can I get in touch?**<br>
You can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/terry_brown), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/terrybrownuk).  I'd love to chat to you if you are considering using this guide in any way, and I'm always open to discussions around the topics covered here - there is so much I don't know.
